# STATE: where the work stands

Rules: replace stale lines, never append history, never record a status that was not
verified this session. The coding agent updates this as its last action; the manager
corrects it after review.

## Now

- **Phase:** 1 of 13 (hidden Android app). **Path A (guest activity launched onto our own
  virtual display) is NO-GO**, confirmed on the phone and in Android's source (see "The
  blocker"). Virtualization itself works. **Path B (show the in-process guest's window on
  our display without launching an activity there) is not tested yet.**
- **Last updated:** 2026-10-15, manager review of the Phase 1 run (commit 19528b3).
- **Next action:** owner approves Phase 1 round 2 (path B, time-boxed). If path B also
  fails, the owner decides the pivot (DECISIONS.md). Do NOT start Phase 2 until then.

## Done (verified on the phone, 2026-10-14)

- **T1 engine** — `docs/PHASE1_ENGINE.md`: pick **Blacks-BlackBox** (Apache-2.0).
- **T2 build (G6)** — the whole `android/` project now **builds**: Java, Kotlin, AIDL, the
  native Dobby+BlackBox engine, dex, APK. Fixes made this session: library `targetSdk`
  removed, AGP-9 `sourceSets` DSL, `local.properties` path, submodule names
  (`:black-reflection`/`:compiler`), dropped the bad kotlin-stdlib pin, Bcore manifest
  wired in, Dobby re-pinned to self-consistent `e9fe7fb` + NDK 26, two Dobby/Bcore source
  patches (case-collision, `Logger::Shared` inline) applied reproducibly in `fetch-source.sh`.
- **T3 virtualization** — BlackBox runs a real Play app (Google Tasks) inside our app
  (ProxyActivity, uid 10189, process `:p0`); it renders. **But on the real screen, not our
  display.** Evidence in `evidence/phase1/`.
- **T5 numbers** — 2 processes (host + `:black`), TOTAL PSS ≈ 43.7 MB. No frame ever lands
  on our display.
- **T6** — `docs/PHASE1_PLAY_POLICY.md` (REQUIRE_SECURE_ENV, avoid QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES).

## The blocker (why NO-GO)

A Play-installed app cannot launch ANY activity (not even its own) onto a virtual display
it creates. Android's check (`ActivityTaskSupervisor.isCallerAllowedToLaunchOnDisplay`,
AOSP main, read by the manager 2026-10-15): an app-made display is untrusted, so the
activity needs `allowEmbedded="true"` AND the caller needs `ACTIVITY_EMBEDDING`
(signature|privileged) or an activity of its uid already on that display (impossible for
the first one). Trusted displays need a system permission; PUBLIC displays need a
MediaProjection grant. Phone evidence: the SecurityException in
`evidence/phase1/selftest_launchDisplayId_denial.txt`. Details and the manager's
corrections in `docs/PHASE1_RESULT.md`.
